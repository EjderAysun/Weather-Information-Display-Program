## Inspiration
Software Engineering 226 (SE 226) Project Instructions (Izmir University of Economics, 2023, SE 226 course, Spring semester project document)
  
As a student of the Izmir University of Economics, I made this project in accordance with the SE 226 Project Instructions for the spring semester project of the SE 226 course in 2023.
  
The project conforms almost exactly to the document.
  
Since the content of the SE 226 projects that will be given in the next periods may be similar to this document, I do not share the document publicly. If you need the document, send an e-mail with the reason to the following address: <ejderaysunn@gmail.com>
